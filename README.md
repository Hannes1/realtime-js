# Realtime Client

Listens to changes in a PostgreSQL Database and broadcasts them over websockets.

# Usage

This is for usage with Supabase Realtime server.

Basic usage:

```js
import { Socket } = '@supabase/realtime-js'

var socket = new Socket(process.env.REALTIME_URL)
socket.connect()

// Listen to only INSERTS on the 'users' table in the 'public' schema
var allChanges = this.socket.channel('realtime:public:users')
  .join()
  .on('INSERT', payload => { console.log('Update received!', payload) })

// Listen to all changes from the 'public' schema
var allChanges = this.socket.channel('realtime:public')
  .join()
  .on('*', payload => { console.log('Update received!', payload) })

// Listen to all changes in the database
let allChanges = this.socket.channel('realtime:*')
  .join()
  .on('*', payload => { console.log('Update received!', payload) })
```
